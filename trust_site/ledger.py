"""Provenance: when each declaration's meaning last changed, across the builds a site has seen.

A dataset knows one commit; history needs a record kept from build to build. The ledger is that
record, one JSON file a deployment carries from one build to the next (committed, or kept as a
release asset):

    {"format": "trust-site-ledger/1",
     "builds": [{"commit": "…", "date": "2026-09-22", "label": "v4.35.0-rc2-1-g61e506b"}, …],
     "decls": {"Bandits.etcAlgorithm": [[0, "<meaning hash>"], [3, "<meaning hash>"]], …}}

Each declaration lists the builds at which its meaning hash was new: when it first appeared, and
each change after that. Nothing else is recorded, so a build that changes nothing adds only its
line to `builds`. A declaration renamed with the same meaning keeps its history (it is found by
meaning hash).

`trust-site ledger --ledger FILE --dataset DIR` records a build; `build --ledger FILE` reads it:
each declaration's page then says when its meaning last changed, and Changes lets a reader pick
the build they last worked through.
