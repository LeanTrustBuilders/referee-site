"""What changed since a baseline dataset, in the classes a returning reader needs.

Each declaration of the baseline is classified as a review made at the baseline would be (S3
statuses, from evidence-core), then refined:

* **statement changed** — the declaration itself was rewritten (its local hash moved) and what it
  states reads differently;
* **body changed** — a definition rewritten while its statement reads the same: its meaning moved
  through its body;
* **meaning changed underneath** — written the same, but something its statement rests on changed
  (the rewritten dependencies are named);
* **proof only** — the meaning is the same and only a proof somewhere in its closure changed: no
  re-reading follows;
* **renamed** — gone under its old name, present under a new one with the same meaning;
* **added**, **removed**.

"Reads differently" compares the `statement` facet's text (binders and conclusion, pretty-printed
by Lean), so a statement whose `variable`s changed counts as changed even though its own source
lines did not.
